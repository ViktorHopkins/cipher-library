# The Cipher Library
## Background
During my final year of 'upper secondary school' (gymnasiet in Swedish), I enrolled in a mathematics specialization course that focused on cryptography. The course was primarily based on Simon Singh's 'The Code Book.' 
 
All students with programming knowledge were strongly encouraged to create programs capable of recreating the ciphers outlined in Singh's book. In this repository, you'll find refactored versions of the C# code that I originally wrote in 2019, which have now been rewritten in Python.
